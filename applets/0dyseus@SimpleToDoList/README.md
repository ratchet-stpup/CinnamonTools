## Description

Applet based on two gnome-shell extensions ([Todo list](https://github.com/bsaleil/todolist-gnome-shell-extension) and [Section Todo List](https://github.com/tomMoral/ToDoList)). It allows to create simple ToDo lists from a menu on the panel.

## Applet usage and features

The usage of this applet is very simple. Each task list is represented by a sub menu and each sub menu item inside a sub menu represents a task.

- To add a new tasks list, simply focus the **New tasks list...** entry, give a name to the tasks list and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
- To add a new task, simply focus the **New task...** entry, give a name to the task and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
- All tasks lists and tasks can be edited in-line.
- Tasks can be marked as completed by changing the checked state of their sub menu items.
- Each tasks list can have its own settings for sorting tasks (by name and/or by completed state), remove task button visibility and completed tasks visibility.
- Each tasks list can be saved as individual TODO files and also can be exported into a file for backup purposes.
- Tasks can be reordered by simply dragging them inside the tasks list they belong to (only if all automatic sorting options for the tasks list are disabled).
- Tasks can be deleted by simply pressing the delete task button (if visible).
- Colorized priority tags support. The background and text colors of a task can be colorized depending on the @tag found inside the task text.
- Configurable hotkey to open/close the menu.
- Read the tooltips of each option on this applet settings window for more details.
