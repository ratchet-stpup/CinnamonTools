## Description

Simple translator applet that will allow to display the translation of any selected text from any application on a system in a popup.

## Dependencies

**If one or more of these dependencies are missing in your system, you will not be able to use this applet.**

### xsel command

XSel is a command-line program for getting and setting the contents of the X selection.

- Debian and Archlinux based distributions: The package is called **xsel**.

### xdg-open command

Open a URI in the user's preferred application that handles the respective URI or file type.

- Debian and Archlinux based distributions: This command is installed with the package called **xdg-utils**. Installed by default in modern versions of Linux Mint.

### Python 3

It should come already installed in all Linux distributions.

### requests Python 3 module

Requests allow you to send HTTP/1.1 requests. You can add headers, form data, multi-part files, and parameters with simple Python dictionaries, and access the response data in the same way. It's powered by httplib and urllib3, but it does all the hard work and crazy hacks for you.

- Debian and Archlinux based distributions: This command is installed with the package called **xdg-utils**. Installed by default in modern versions of Linux Mint.
- Debian based distributions: The package is called **python3-requests**. Installed by default in modern versions of Linux Mint.
- Archlinux based distributions: The package is called **python-requests**.

**After installing any of the missing dependencies, Cinnamon needs to be restarted**

**Note:** I don't use any other type of Linux distribution (Gentoo based, Slackware based, etc.). If any of the previous packages/modules are named differently, please, let me know and I will specify them in this help file.
