## Desktop Handler applet description

This applet is based on [Smart Panel](https://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/extensions/view/32) extension and [Show Desktop ++](https://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/applets/view/165) applet, both authored by  **mohammad-sn**. I *mixed* both of them into an applet because there is not always room on the panel to perform the actions added by **Smart Panel**. The **Smart Panel** extension can still be installed and activated at the same time than this applet to have even more desktop actions.
