## Dependencies

- **xsel** command: XSel is a command-line program for getting and setting the contents of the X selection.
    - Debian and Arch Linux based distributions: The package is called **xsel**.
- **xdg-open** command: Open a URI in the user's preferred application that handles the respective URI or file type.
    - Debian and Arch Linux based distributions: This command is installed with the package called **xdg-utils**. Installed by default in modern versions of Linux Mint.
- **Python 3**: It should come already installed in all Linux distributions.
- **requests** Python 3 module: Requests allow you to send HTTP/1.1 requests. You can add headers, form data, multi-part files, and parameters with simple Python dictionaries, and access the response data in the same way. It's powered by httplib and urllib3, but it does all the hard work and crazy hacks for you.
    - Debian based distributions: The package is called **python3-requests**. Installed by default in modern versions of Linux Mint.
    - Arch Linux based distributions: The package is called **python-requests**.

**Note:** I don't use any other type of Linux distribution (Gentoo based, Slackware based, etc.). If any of the previous packages/modules are named differently, please, let me know.
