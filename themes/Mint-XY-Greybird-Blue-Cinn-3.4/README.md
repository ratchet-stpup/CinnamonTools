## Mint-XY-Greybird-Blue-Cinn-3.4 theme description

<span style="color:red;">
This is a Cinnamon theme only (Desktop). I doesn't have gtk2/gtk3 themes (Controls) and it doesn't have a Metacity theme (Windows borders).
</span>

This theme complements the [**Mint-XY-Greybird-Blue** theme](https://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/themes/view/Mint-XY-Greybird-Blue). The Cinnamon theme (Desktop) shipped with the **Mint-XY-Greybird-Blue** theme is only compatible with Cinnamon up to version 3.2.x.
